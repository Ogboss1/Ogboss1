## Hi,ðŸ‘‹Iâ€™m @Ogboss1
A Software Engineer who specializes in using software engineering tools to help organizations change the world.

I've spent the last few years working on a number of amazing projects: landing pages, a browser extension, school management software, community websites, and an online conference app for event planners.

Professional: Advanced Technical Writing | Documentation | Remote Pair-Programming | Teamwork | Mentoring | Project Management.

Passionate about ideating, conceptualizing, and producing consumer-centric technology and technology-enabled products from level zero. Open for exploring exciting full-stack development opportunities in startups as well as companies with scale.
